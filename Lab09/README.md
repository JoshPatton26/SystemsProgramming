This assignment asked me to modify a given source code, that uses the fork-exec-wait method, and allow for Control-C, Control-Z signals to interrupt or suspend the parent process, until the Control-\ signal is given to quit the program. I combined some code from the source code sighandler.c to the code in forkexecvp.c file to make my program recognize when a signal is given by the user as well as run an infinite for loop to give the user the opportunity to enter the signals listed above. 

I ran my code on the Vulcan server which all seemed to run fine with no errors or warnings on my local machine. 

To test my code you can compile it by "gcc -o lab09 lab09.c" and to run it use "./lab09 (Linux Cmd)". I tested mine using the 'ls' command which executed fine then hit the infinite loop to where I was able to enter the given signals which returned the correct signal number, and when Control-\ was entered it terminated my code.
