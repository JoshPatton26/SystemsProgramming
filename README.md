# Systems Programming
Welcome to the repository for the <b>CS332 Systems Programming</b> course at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). This repository houses all of my coursework completed during the course, with a focus on programming in the C language. The projects and assignments were developed using the Vulcan server (Owned by UAB) for compilation and execution. If Vulcan is inaccessible, the code can be compiled and run using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu. I utilized Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my IDE for coding, leveraging MSYS2 MinGW 64x as my compiler to manage included libraries for each project.

  <b>Note:</b> The content in this repository represents my work completed during the <b>Systems Programming</b> course at UAB. UAB owns the rights the the Vulcan server, unauthorized access is prohibited. The projects and assignments delve into various systems programming concepts, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of modern computing systems. While VSCode serves as the primary IDE for code editing, the actual compilation and execution might require Vulcan or WSL with Ubuntu.
