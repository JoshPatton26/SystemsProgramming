# CS332-SystemsProgramming

This repository contains all my work from the CS332 Systems Programming course at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. The entire repository is 
written in C using the Vulcan server to compile and run my code. For those who can't access the Vulcan, WSL with Ubuntu will compile and run the code 
just fine. I am using VSCode as my IDE to help edit the code with better visuals and using MSYS2 MinGW 64x as my compiler to help read the libraries 
that are included for each project. However, I have not been able to compile and run my code through VSCode, so I use it strictly for code editing.
